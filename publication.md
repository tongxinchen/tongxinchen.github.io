Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the relationships between different groups of 
explanatory variables (i.e., dynamic human activity variables, static variables 
of social disorganisation and crime generators, and combinations of both sets of variables) 
and property crime patterns across neighbourhood areas of London during the pandemic (from 2020 to 2021). 
Using the dynamic human activity variables sensed from mobile phone GPS big data sets, 
three types of ‘Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator’ (LASSO) regression 
models (i.e., static, dynamic, and static and dynamic) differentiated into explanatory 
variable groups were developed for seven types of property crime. Then, the geographically 
weighted regression (GWR) model was used to reveal the spatial associations between distinct explanatory 
variables and the specific type of crime. The findings demonstrated that human activity dynamics impose 
a substantially stronger influence on specific types of property crimes than other static variables. 
In terms of crime type, theft obtained particularly high relationships with dynamic human activity 
compared to other property crimes. Further analysis revealed important nuances in the spatial associations 
between property crimes and human activity across different contexts during the pandemic. 
The result provides support for crime risk prediction that considers the impact of dynamic human activity 
variables and their varying influences in distinct situations.
