Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the relationships between different groups of 
explanatory variables (i.e., dynamic human activity variables, static variables 
of social disorganisation and crime generators, and combinations of both sets of variables) 
and property crime patterns across neighbourhood areas of London during the pandemic (from 2020 to 2021). 
Using the dynamic human activity variables sensed from mobile phone GPS big data sets, 
three types of ‘Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator’ (LASSO) regression 
models (i.e., static, dynamic, and static and dynamic) differentiated into explanatory 
variable groups were developed for seven types of property crime. Then, the geographically 
weighted regression (GWR) model was used to reveal the spatial associations between distinct explanatory 
variables and the specific type of crime. The findings demonstrated that human activity dynamics impose 
a substantially stronger influence on specific types of property crimes than other static variables. 
In terms of crime type, theft obtained particularly high relationships with dynamic human activity 
compared to other property crimes. Further analysis revealed important nuances in the spatial associations 
between property crimes and human activity across different contexts during the pandemic. 
The result provides support for crime risk prediction that considers the impact of dynamic human activity 
variables and their varying influences in distinct situations.

Exploration of dynamic human activity gives significant insights into understanding the urban environment and
can help to reinforce scientific urban management strategies. 
Lots of studies are arising regarding the significant human activity changes in global metropolises 
and regions affected by COVID-19 containment policies. However, the variations of human activity 
dynamics amid different phases divided by the non-pharmaceutical intervention policies
(e.g., stay-at-home, lockdown) have not been investigated across urban areas in space and time and discussed
with the urban characteristic determinants. In this study, we aim to explore the influence of 
different restriction phases on dynamic human activity through sensing human activity zones (HAZs) 
and their dominated urban characteristics. Herein, we proposed an explainable analysis framework to 
explore the HAZ variations consisting of three parts, i.e., footfall detection, HAZs delineation and 
the identification of relationships between urban characteristics and HAZs. In our study area of Greater 
London, United Kingdom, we first utilised the footfall detection method to extract human activity metrics 
(footfalls) counted by visits/stays at space and time from the anonymous mobile phone GPS trajectories. 
Then, we characterised HAZs based on the homogeneity of daily human footfalls at census output areas (OAs) 
during the predefined restriction phases in the UK. Lastly, we examined the feature importance of 
explanatory variables as the metric of the relationship between human activity and urban characteristics 
using machine learning classifiers. The results show that dynamic human activity exhibits statistically 
significant differences in terms of the HAZ distributions across restriction phases and is strongly 
associated with urban characteristics (e.g., specific land use types) during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
These findings can improve the understanding of the variation of human activity patterns during the 
pandemic and offer insights into city management resource allocation in urban areas concerning dynamic 
human activity.
